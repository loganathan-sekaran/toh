- Prevents duplicate names
- **Test Result**: UI working, validation in place

### 4. Sortable Table ↕️
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
- All 8 columns are sortable (click headers)
- Columns: Bookmark, Name, Architecture, Created, Episodes, Success Rate, Avg Steps, Epsilon
- Proper data types for numeric sorting
- Disable during loading to prevent issues
- **Implementation**: `setSortingEnabled(True)`

### 5. Resizable Columns 📏
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
- All columns except bookmark are resizable
- Drag column edges to adjust width
- Bookmark column fixed at 40px
- Interactive resize mode for flexibility
- **Implementation**: `QHeaderView.ResizeMode.Interactive`

### 6. Performance Graph Layout 📊
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
- Changed from side-by-side (horizontal) to stacked (vertical)
- Graph now at bottom with full width
- Visualizer on top gets 2x space
- Graph at bottom gets 1x space
- Much better visibility and readability
- **Implementation**: Changed `QHBoxLayout` to `QVBoxLayout` with stretch ratios

## Files Modified

### 1. model_manager.py
**New Methods Added**:
```python
def update_metadata(name, updates)
    # Update any metadata fields for a model
    
def rename_model(old_name, new_name)
    # Rename model directory and update metadata
```
**Purpose**: Backend support for all metadata operations

### 2. model_selection_dialog.py
**Major Changes**:
- Added bookmark column (column 0)
- Shifted all other columns right by 1
- Added 3 new buttons: Bookmark, Comment, Rename
- Made table sortable
- Made columns resizable
- Updated data storage to use column 1 (name)

**New Methods Added**:
```python
def toggle_bookmark()
    # Toggle bookmark status with visual feedback
    
def edit_comment()
    # Multi-line comment editor dialog
    
def rename_model()
    # Rename with validation and error handling
```

**Enhanced Methods**:
- `load_models()`: Added bookmark display, proper sorting, numeric data types
- `on_selection_changed()`: Display bookmark and comment in details

### 3. gui_launcher.py
**Changes**:
- `show_visualization_page()`: Changed layout from horizontal to vertical
- Performance graph now at bottom instead of side-by-side
- Better space utilization (2:1 ratio)

## Testing Results

### Model Selection Dialog Test
```
✅ Found 19 models
✅ Dialog opened successfully
✅ Bookmarked a model → Status: True
✅ Added comment → "Solving in steps: 8"
✅ Metadata persisted correctly
✅ All buttons functional
```

### Features Verified
- ✅ Bookmark toggle works
- ✅ Comment editor opens and saves
- ✅ Rename button present (validation works)
- ✅ Table sorting enabled
- ✅ Columns are resizable
- ✅ Yellow background for bookmarked models
- ✅ Star icon displays correctly

## Table Layout

### Before (7 columns):
```
Model Name | Architecture | Created | Episodes | Success Rate | Avg Steps | Epsilon
```

### After (8 columns):
```
★ | Model Name | Architecture | Created | Episodes | Success Rate | Avg Steps | Epsilon
```

### Column Properties:
- Column 0 (★): Fixed width (40px), sortable
- Columns 1-7: Interactive resize, sortable
- All columns: Click header to sort

## UI Improvements

### Model Selection Dialog
```
Before:
[Refresh] [Preview] [Delete] [Cancel] [Load]

After:
[Refresh] [⭐ Bookmark] [💬 Comment] [✏️ Rename] [Preview] [Delete] [Cancel] [Load]
```

### Training Page Layout
```
Before:                          After:
┌─────────┬─────────┐           ┌─────────────────┐
│ Visual  │  Graph  │           │   Visualizer    │
│ (50%)   │  (50%)  │           │   (full width)  │
│         │ cramped │    →      ├─────────────────┤
└─────────┴─────────┘           │ Performance     │
                                │ Graph (full)    │
                                └─────────────────┘
```

## Metadata Structure

### Enhanced Model Metadata:
```json
{
  "name": "best_3disc_solver",
  "bookmarked": true,              // NEW
  "comment": "Best performer",     // NEW
  "created_at": "2025-10-28T14:30:22",
  "architecture": "Large (128-64-32)",
  "episodes": 1000,
  "success_rate": 95.5,
  "avg_steps": 8.2,
  "epsilon": 0.01
}
```

## User Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Organize Models
1. Open model selection
2. Sort by "Success Rate" (click header)
3. Bookmark top 3 models
4. Add comments explaining why they're good
5. Rename them to meaningful names

### Example 2: Track Experiments
1. Train new model with experimental settings
2. Add comment: "Testing new reward system with 2x placement bonus"
3. Bookmark if performance is good
4. Compare with other bookmarked models

### Example 3: Clean Up Old Models
1. Sort by "Created" date
2. Review old models
3. Delete poor performers
4. Rename keepers with descriptive names
5. Add comments for future reference
