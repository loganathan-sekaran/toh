# Migration to Gymnasium

## What Changed?

The project has been updated to use **Gymnasium** instead of the deprecated **Gym** library.

### Why?

- OpenAI Gym was deprecated and is no longer maintained
- Gymnasium is the official successor, maintained by the Farama Foundation
- Gymnasium provides better compatibility with modern Python versions
- It includes bug fixes and improvements over the original Gym

### What Was Updated?

1. **Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
   - Changed: `gym` → `gymnasium`

2. **Code** (`toh.py`)
   - Changed: `from gym.spaces import ...` → `from gymnasium.spaces import ...`
   - Removed duplicate action_space property definition

3. **Documentation** (`README.md`, `SETUP.md`)
   - Updated references to reflect Gymnasium usage

### Compatibility

The API is almost identical, so the migration is seamless:
- All `gym.spaces` classes work the same in `gymnasium.spaces`
- Environment interface remains unchanged
- No changes needed in your training code

### Verification

The environment has been tested and verified:
```
✓ Environment created successfully
✓ Action space: Discrete(6)
✓ Observation space: Box(0, 3, (3, 3), int32)
✓ DQN Agent created successfully
```

### If You Had the Old Version

If you already had the old version with `gym`, simply:

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or manually
pip uninstall gym
pip install gymnasium
```

Everything else remains the same - your training scripts, models, and workflows are unchanged!
