# Model Saving Fix

## Problem Identified

**Issue:** Models trained for 500+ episodes were not available after training stopped.

**Root Cause:** The training code only saved models when training completed **all** episodes normally. If training was stopped early (via Stop button, window close, crash, or kill), the model was never saved.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Save on Early Stop
Modified `TrainingWorker.run()` to save the model even when training is stopped prematurely:

```python
if self.should_stop or self.visualizer.should_stop:
    # Save model before stopping
    self._save_current_model(episode - 1, episode_steps_list)
    self.finished.emit(f"Training stopped at episode {episode-1}. Model saved.")
    return
```

### 2. Periodic Checkpoints
Added automatic checkpoint saving every 100 episodes:

```python
# Save checkpoint every 100 episodes (to prevent data loss)
if episode % 100 == 0 and episode < self.config['episodes']:
    self._save_current_model(episode, episode_steps_list)
    print(f"Checkpoint saved at episode {episode}")
```

### 3. Centralized Save Method
Created `_save_current_model()` method to handle all save operations consistently:

```python
def _save_current_model(self, episodes_completed, episode_steps_list):
    """Save the current model with metadata."""
    # Calculates metrics and saves model with metadata
    # Used by: final completion, early stop, checkpoints
```

## Benefits

1. **No Data Loss:** Models are now saved even if training is interrupted
2. **Checkpoint Safety:** Every 100 episodes, a checkpoint is automatically saved
3. **Accurate Metadata:** Saved models include actual episodes completed, not target episodes
4. **Consistent Behavior:** All save operations use the same method

## Model Save Locations

Models are saved to: `/Users/loganathan.sekaran/git/toh/models/`

Each model directory contains:
- `model.keras` - The trained neural network weights
- `metadata.json` - Training statistics and configuration

Example:
```
models/
  └── dqn_model_20251028_105000/
      ├── model.keras
      └── metadata.json
```

## Metadata Included

Each saved model includes:
- `episodes`: Number of episodes completed
- `num_discs`: Number of discs in Tower of Hanoi
- `success_rate`: Percentage of successful episodes
- `avg_steps`: Average steps per episode
- `final_epsilon`: Final exploration rate
- `total_steps`: Total steps across all episodes
- `architecture`: Model architecture name (e.g., "Medium (64-32)")
- `created_at`: Timestamp of model save

## Testing

To verify model saving works:

```bash
# Start training via GUI
./start_gui.sh

# Train for any number of episodes, then:
# - Click Stop button, OR
# - Close the window, OR
# - Let it complete normally

# Check that model was saved
ls -la models/
```

## Loading Saved Models

Models can be loaded via:

1. **GUI Test Mode:** Click "Test" button and select from list
2. **Programmatically:**
   ```python
   from model_manager import ModelManager
   
   manager = ModelManager()
   agent, metadata = manager.load_model('dqn_model_20251028_105000')
   print(f"Loaded model trained for {metadata['episodes']} episodes")
   print(f"Success rate: {metadata['success_rate']:.1f}%")
   ```

## Next Steps

When training for 500 episodes again:
1. You'll get checkpoint saves at episodes 100, 200, 300, 400
2. Final save at episode 500 (or whenever you stop)
3. All models will be available in the Test mode model selector
4. No more "model not available" issues!
