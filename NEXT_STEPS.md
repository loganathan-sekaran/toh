# Next Steps: Testing Variable Disc Count Generalization

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All code changes for variable disc count support have been successfully implemented:

1. **Fixed Maximum State Size**: All models now train with `state_size = 30` (supports up to 10 discs)
2. **Consistent State Padding**: Both training and testing use the same padding approach
3. **Test Configuration**: Test dialog allows testing with any disc count up to model capacity
4. **Documentation**: See `VARIABLE_DISC_FIX.md` for comprehensive details

## 🚀 Ready to Test

Your existing 4-disc model is **incompatible** with the new system (it has state_size=12, but the new system requires state_size=30). You need to train a new model.

## 📋 Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Train with 3 Discs
1. Launch the GUI: `./start_gui.sh`
2. Click **"Train Model"**
3. Configure:
   - Number of discs: **3**
   - Episodes: **1000** (or 500 for quick test)
   - Architecture: **Medium** or **Large** (recommended)
   - Learning rate: **0.001** (default)
4. Click **"Start Training"**
5. Wait for completion (~5-10 minutes)

### Step 2: Continue Training with 4 Discs
1. Click **"Continue Training"**
2. Select the model you just trained (should be at the top)
3. Configure:
   - Number of discs: **4**
   - Episodes: **1000**
4. Click **"Start Training"**
5. Wait for completion (~10-15 minutes)

### Step 3: Test Variable Disc Counts
1. Click **"Test Model"**
2. Select the same model
3. Configure:
   - Number of discs: **3**
   - Max steps: **500**
   - Animation: **Enabled** (recommended for visual verification)
4. Click **"Run Test"**
5. **Expected result**: Should solve in ~7-15 moves, no loops

6. Test again with **4 discs**:
   - Click **"Test Model"**
   - Select the same model
   - Number of discs: **4**
   - Click **"Run Test"**
7. **Expected result**: Should solve in ~15-31 moves, no loops

### Step 4: Optional - Train with 5 Discs
1. Click **"Continue Training"**
2. Select the same model
3. Configure:
   - Number of discs: **5**
   - Episodes: **2000** (5 discs is harder, needs more training)
4. Test with 3, 4, and 5 discs to verify full generalization

## ✅ Success Criteria

**The fix is working if:**
- ✅ Model solves 3 discs without loops
- ✅ Model solves 4 discs without loops
- ✅ Performance is reasonable (within 2-3x optimal moves)
- ✅ No repeated action patterns like `1→5→1→4→1→4...`

**If you see loops:**
- ❌ Report the disc count where it fails
- ❌ Share the test output showing the loop pattern
- ❌ We may need to adjust the padding approach

## 🔍 What Changed

### Before (Old System - BROKEN):
```python
# Training: state_size = num_discs * 3
# - 3 discs → state_size = 9
# - 4 discs → state_size = 12
# Problem: Each disc count created a different model structure
```

### After (New System - FIXED):
```python
# Training: state_size = 30 (always)
# - 3 discs → 9 elements + 21 padding = 30 total
# - 4 discs → 12 elements + 18 padding = 30 total
# - 5 discs → 15 elements + 15 padding = 30 total
# Solution: Single model structure works with all disc counts
```

## 📊 Model Metadata

The model you train will have:
- **state_size**: 30 (supports up to 10 discs)
- **Training history**: Will accumulate across 3, 4, 5 disc training sessions
- **Generalization**: Can test with any disc count from 3 to 10

## 🎯 Your Goal

Train ONE model that can solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with ANY disc count (within capacity). This enables:
- Testing flexibility (same model, different challenges)
- Research into generalization capabilities
- Efficient model management (one model instead of many)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start small**: Train with 3 discs first to verify the system works
2. **Incremental training**: Add one disc count at a time (3→4→5)
3. **Monitor performance**: Watch the performance graph during training
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with all trained disc counts after each training session
5. **Be patient**: Higher disc counts need significantly more episodes

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

1. Check that you're using the new code (state_size should be 30)
2. Verify the model was trained with the new system (not an old model)
3. Look for error messages in the terminal/console
4. Check the training reports in `models/<model_name>/learning_reports/`
5. Report the issue with specific details (disc count, episode count, error message)
