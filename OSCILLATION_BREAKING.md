# Learning Improvements: Oscillation Breaking

## Problem Identified

The DQN agent was **detecting oscillations but not learning from them**. Key issues:

1. **Warnings without action**: Agent printed oscillation warnings but continued the same behavior
2. **Insufficient penalties**: Negative rewards weren't strong enough to discourage oscillations
3. **No escape mechanism**: Once stuck in oscillation, epsilon decay made it harder to explore alternatives
4. **Poor learning feedback**: Agent accumulated penalties but Q-values didn't update fast enough to prevent loops

## Root Cause

The agent was stuck in **exploitation loops** where:
- Q-values for oscillating actions became locally optimal
- Low epsilon (after decay) meant less exploration
- Penalties accumulated but didn't break the immediate action loop
- Target network updates were too slow to reflect new knowledge

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Forced Random Exploration** (`dqn_agent.py`)

When oscillation is detected, the agent now:
- Forces 10 random actions to break the loop
- Boosts epsilon by +0.3 (capped at 1.0) to encourage exploration
- Tracks forced action counter to ensure exploration happens

```python
# If oscillation detected, force random exploration for next 10 actions
if oscillation_detected:
    self.force_random_actions = 10
    # Also boost epsilon temporarily to encourage more exploration
    self.epsilon = min(1.0, self.epsilon + 0.3)
```

### 2. **Increased Penalty Scaling**

- Base penalty scaling: 2.0x for regular penalties
- **Oscillation penalty scaling: 3.0x** for severe penalties (< -10)
- This makes oscillation experiences much more impactful during replay

```python
if reward < -10:
    scaled_reward = reward * self.oscillation_penalty_scale  # 3.0x
else:
    scaled_reward = reward * self.penalty_scale  # 2.0x
```

### 3. **Oscillation Detection Types**

The agent detects and breaks three types of oscillations:

1. **Repetitive single action**: A,A,A,A,A,A... (same action 6+ times)
2. **2-action cycle**: A,B,A,B,A,B... (alternating between 2 actions)
3. **3-action cycle**: A,B,C,A,B,C... (repeating 3-action pattern)

## Expected Learning Improvements

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Agent stuck in 100-900 step oscillation loops
- ❌ Success rate declining continuously
- ❌ No learning from repeated mistakes
- ❌ Penalties accumulated but behavior unchanged

### After Fix:
- ✅ Oscillations detected → forced exploration breaks loops
- ✅ Higher penalty scaling → faster Q-value updates
- ✅ Epsilon boost → more exploration when stuck
- ✅ Agent escapes local minima through random actions

## How It Works

### Detection Phase:
1. Track last 20 actions in `recent_actions` deque
2. Every action, check last 6 actions for patterns
3. If oscillation pattern found → set `force_random_actions = 10`

### Breaking Phase:
1. Agent forced to take 10 random actions (decrementing counter)
2. Epsilon boosted by +0.3 to encourage continued exploration
3. Random actions likely to discover new states/actions
4. Q-values update from the oscillation penalties during replay

### Learning Phase:
1. Oscillation experiences stored with 3x penalty scaling
2. During replay(), these high-penalty experiences update Q-values strongly
3. Agent learns: oscillating actions → very negative Q-values
4. Future exploitation phase will avoid these actions

## Testing

Run the test script to verify oscillation breaking:

```bash
python test_oscillation_break.py
```

Expected output:
- ✓ 2-action oscillation detected after 6 steps
- ✓ Forced exploration activated (10 random actions)
- ✓ Epsilon boosted from 0.5 to 0.8
- ✓ Random actions taken while counter > 0

## Training Recommendations

1. **Monitor progress section** in GUI for:
   - Success rate should stabilize or increase
   - Average steps should decrease over episodes
   - Best success rate should improve

2. **Watch for signs of learning**:
   - Fewer oscillation warnings over time
   - Episodes completing in fewer steps
   - Success rate trending upward after initial exploration

3. **If still struggling**:
   - Increase `oscillation_penalty_scale` to 4.0 or 5.0
   - Increase `force_random_actions` to 15 or 20
   - Decrease `epsilon_decay` to slow exploration reduction

## Configuration Parameters

Current settings in `dqn_agent.py`:

```python
self.epsilon = 0.5  # Start with 50% exploration
self.epsilon_decay = 0.99  # Decay to min in ~100 episodes
self.learning_rate = 0.003  # Fast learning from penalties
self.penalty_scale = 2.0  # Regular penalty scaling
self.oscillation_penalty_scale = 3.0  # Extra scaling for oscillations
self.force_random_actions = 0  # Counter for forced exploration
self.oscillation_threshold = 6  # Detect pattern in 6 actions
```

## Architecture Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **dqn_agent.py**: 
   - Added `force_random_actions` counter
   - Added `oscillation_penalty_scale` parameter
   - Modified `act()` to force exploration on oscillation
   - Modified `remember()` to apply extra penalty scaling
   
2. **test_oscillation_break.py** (new):
   - Verification script for oscillation breaking mechanism

## Impact on Learning Curve

**Expected training behavior**:

- **Episodes 1-50**: High exploration, many oscillations detected, frequent forced exploration
- **Episodes 50-100**: Fewer oscillations as Q-values learn to avoid them, success rate improving
- **Episodes 100-200**: Stable learning, occasional oscillations in new states, consistent success
- **Episodes 200+**: Expert behavior, minimal oscillations, near-optimal solutions

The agent should now **actively break oscillation loops** rather than getting stuck, leading to much better learning outcomes and improving success rates over time.
