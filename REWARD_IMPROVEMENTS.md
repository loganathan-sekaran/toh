# Tower of Hanoi - Enhanced Reward System Summary

## Progressive Placement Reward System ✓

### What Changed
Implemented a sophisticated reward system that guides the agent to build the solution from largest to smallest disc, rewarding correct placements and penalizing removals.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Sequential Target Tracking**
- Tracks the current target disc (starts with largest)
- Maintains a set of correctly placed discs
- Updates target to next smaller disc after correct placement

#### 2. **Placement Rewards (+30)**
- **Largest disc (N)**: Reward when placed alone on target rod
- **Smaller discs (N-1, N-2, ...)**: Reward when placed on top of next larger disc that's already correctly placed
- Ensures discs are built in correct order: bottom (largest) → top (smallest)

#### 3. **Removal Penalties (-40)**
- Heavy penalty for removing any correctly placed disc from target rod
- Discourages undoing progress
- Prevents oscillation between correct and incorrect states

#### 4. **Maintenance Rewards (+1)**
- Small continuous reward for keeping correctly placed discs on target
- Encourages preserving correct state while working on remaining discs

### Example Results

**3-Disc Optimal Solution (7 moves):**
```
Move 1: Disc 1 → Rod 2          | Reward: +7.9
Move 2: Disc 2 → Rod 1          | Reward: -0.1
Move 3: Disc 1 → Rod 1          | Reward: -0.1
Move 4: Disc 3 → Rod 2 ✓        | Reward: +83.9  (TARGET PLACED!)
Move 5: Disc 1 → Rod 0          | Reward: +2.9
Move 6: Disc 2 → Rod 2 ✓        | Reward: +38.9  (TARGET PLACED!)
Move 7: Disc 1 → Rod 2 ✓        | Reward: +300.0 (SOLVED!)
```

### Benefits

✅ **Prevents Oscillation**: Heavy penalties for removing correctly placed discs  
✅ **Clear Learning Path**: Sequential targets from largest to smallest  
✅ **Incremental Progress**: Substantial rewards for each correct placement  
✅ **Faster Convergence**: Agent learns optimal strategy more quickly  
✅ **Valid Solutions**: Ensures discs are placed in correct order  

## Complete Reward Structure

### 1. Invalid Move (-50)
Attempting to place larger disc on smaller disc

### 2. Progressive Placement
- Correct placement: +30
- Removal of correct disc: -40
- Maintenance: +1 per correct disc

### 3. Repetition Detection
- Immediate reversal: -10
- Repeating same move: -8
- 2-move cycle (A-B-A-B): -15
- 3-move cycle (A-B-C-A-B-C): -20

### 4. Largest Disc Strategy
- Moving to target rod: +20
- Moving to wrong rod: -15

### 5. Goal Progress
- Moving disc to goal: +5
- Correct bottom placement: +3

### 6. Completion Rewards
- New best performance: 100 + efficiency bonus
- Optimal solution: +200
- Good solution (≤150% optimal): +80
- Any completion: +50

### 7. Efficiency
- Base penalty per move: -0.1 (encourages fewer steps)

## Testing

### Test Progressive Placement
```bash
python test_progressive_rewards.py
```

Shows:
- Rewards for correct placements
- Penalties for removals
- Optimal solution walkthrough
- Progressive tracking demonstration

### Train with New System
```bash
./start_gui.sh
```

- Click "Train New Model"
- Select architecture and disc count
- Observe training progress with improved rewards

### Continue Training Existing Models
```bash
./start_gui.sh
```

- Click "Continue Training"
- Select existing model
- Choose to keep or reset epsilon
- Option to transfer learn to different disc count

## Expected Improvements

With the progressive placement system, models should:

1. **Learn faster**: Clear reward signal for correct strategy
2. **Fewer oscillations**: Heavy penalties prevent backtracking
3. **Better solutions**: Guided toward building from bottom up
4. **Stable learning**: Incremental progress with locked-in placements
5. **Transfer learning**: Strategy learned on N discs helps with N±1 discs

## Files Modified

- **toh.py**: Added progressive placement tracking and rewards
- **test_progressive_rewards.py**: Test script demonstrating the system
- **PROGRESSIVE_PLACEMENT.md**: Detailed documentation

## Configuration

Key variables in `TowerOfHanoiEnv`:
```python
self.correctly_placed_discs = set()     # Discs correctly placed on target
self.current_target_disc = num_discs    # Next disc to place (largest first)
```

Reward values (can be tuned):
```python
correct_placement_reward = +30
removal_penalty = -40
maintenance_reward = +1
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Training Strategy

1. **Train fresh model** with new reward system (500-1000 episodes)
2. **Test model** with different disc counts (3-5 discs)
3. **Compare** with old models to see improvement
4. **Fine-tune** reward values if needed
5. **Transfer learn** successful models to harder problems

### Monitor These Metrics

- Success rate (should increase faster)
- Average steps (should decrease toward optimal)
- Epsilon decay (exploration → exploitation)
- Correctly placed discs per episode (should increase)
- Removal count (should decrease over time)

## Troubleshooting

### If agent still oscillates:
- Increase removal penalty (try -50 or -60)
- Decrease maintenance reward (try +0.5)

### If agent is too conservative:
- Decrease removal penalty (try -30)
- Increase placement reward (try +40)

### If learning is slow:
- Increase placement reward (try +40)
- Add more positive feedback for partial progress

## Summary

The progressive placement reward system provides a structured learning path that:
- Rewards building the solution incrementally
- Penalizes undoing progress
- Maintains valid disc ordering
- Reduces oscillation and repetitive moves
- Accelerates learning toward optimal solutions

Test it out and train new models to see the improvements!
