# Advanced Reward Shaping System

## Overview
Implemented sophisticated reward shaping based on 6 learning logic rules to dramatically improve agent learning efficiency and prevent common pitfalls.

## Reward Logic Implementation

### 1. Invalid Move Detection (Moving disc on larger disc)
**Logic**: "It has to understand that it is moving a disk on a non small disk. otherwise penalty."

```python
if not is_valid_move(from_rod, to_rod):
    reward = -50  # HEAVY PENALTY
    return immediately
```

**Impact**: Agent quickly learns basic Tower of Hanoi rules.

---

### 2. Largest Disc Strategy
**Logic**: "The largest disk has to be moved to the target rod, if it got moved to the other rod, then penalty"

```python
if disc == largest_disc:
    if to_rod == 2:  # Target rod
        reward += 20  # BIG reward!
    else:
        reward -= 15  # Penalty for wrong rod
```

**Impact**: Agent learns the fundamental strategy - get the largest disc to the goal first.

---

### 3. Efficiency Learning (Progressive Improvement)
**Logic**: "If same sequence should be achieved in much lesser steps, reward. If increasing steps, penalty."

```python
if puzzle_complete:
    if steps < best_steps:
        # New best! Reward improvement
        efficiency_bonus = (best_steps - steps) * 20
        reward += 100 + efficiency_bonus
        best_steps = steps  # Update best
    elif steps == optimal_steps:
        reward += 200  # OPTIMAL!
    elif steps <= optimal_steps * 1.5:
        reward += 80   # Good
    else:
        reward += 50   # Completed but inefficient
```

**How it works**:
- Tracks `best_steps` across all episodes
- First completion: Gets base reward
- Better completion: Gets bonus proportional to improvement
- Worse completion: Gets lower reward (implicit penalty)

**Impact**: Agent is incentivized to continuously improve, not just complete the puzzle.

### 4. Repetition Detection (Prevent Oscillation)
**Logic**: "Should not repeat disc movement between two rods again and again, penalty. Try other possible steps."

```python
recent_moves = [(from, to, disc), ...]  # Last 4 moves

# Detect immediate reversal
if reverse_move == recent_moves[-1]:
    reward -= 10  # Heavy penalty for undo

# Detect repeated patterns
if move appears 2+ times in recent_moves:
    reward -= 5   # Penalty for cycling
```

**Example of what this prevents**:
```
❌ BAD: Disc 1: Rod 0→1, Rod 1→0, Rod 0→1, Rod 1→0 (oscillating)
✓ GOOD: Disc 1: Rod 0→1, Disc 2: Rod 0→2, Disc 1: Rod 1→2 (progressive)
```

**Impact**: Agent learns to make progress, not waste moves.

---

### 5. Multiple-Step Sequence Repetition Detection
**Logic**: "Multiple steps also should not be repeated. If same sequence of steps repeating more than once then penalty."

```python
move_sequence_history = [...]  # Last 12 moves

# Detect 2-move cycles (A-B-A-B)
if last 4 moves form pattern [A, B, A, B]:
    reward -= 15  # Heavy penalty for 2-move cycle

# Detect 3-move cycles (A-B-C-A-B-C)
if last 6 moves form pattern [A, B, C, A, B, C]:
    reward -= 20  # Even heavier penalty for 3-move cycle
```

**Example of what this prevents**:
```
❌ BAD: Move A, Move B, Move A, Move B (2-step cycle)
❌ BAD: Move A, Move B, Move C, Move A, Move B, Move C (3-step cycle)
✓ GOOD: Move A, Move B, Move C, Move D (unique moves)
```

**Impact**: Agent learns to avoid complex oscillation patterns that waste many moves.

---

### 6. Largest Disc Permanence on Target
**Logic**: "If the target rod is containing the biggest disk then reward, if it is taken out then penalty."

```python
was_largest_on_target = (largest_disc in target_rod before move)
is_largest_on_target = (largest_disc in target_rod after move)

if is_largest_on_target and not was_largest_on_target:
    reward += 25  # Big reward for placing it there!
elif not is_largest_on_target and was_largest_on_target:
    reward -= 30  # HEAVY penalty for removing it!
elif is_largest_on_target and was_largest_on_target:
    reward += 2   # Small bonus for keeping it there
```

**Example**:
```
✓ GOOD: Largest disc moved to target → +25 reward
✓ GOOD: Largest disc stays on target during other moves → +2 per step
❌ BAD: Largest disc removed from target → -30 penalty
```

**Impact**: Agent learns that once the largest disc reaches the target, it should NEVER be moved again. This is a fundamental Tower of Hanoi principle.

## Additional Reward Shaping

### Goal Progress Rewards
```python
if disc moved to goal rod (rod 2):
    reward += 5  # Progress towards goal
    
if disc in correct position on goal:
    reward += 3  # Proper stacking
```

### Base Step Penalty
```python
reward = -0.1  # Small penalty per step (encourage efficiency)
```

- Learns valid vs invalid moves
- Avoids -50 penalties
- Random exploration with valid moves only

### Phase 2: Strategy Discovery (Episodes 50-150)
- Discovers largest disc must go to target (+20, +25 rewards)
- Learns to keep largest disc on target (+2 per step)
- Learns to avoid oscillation (-10, -15, -20 penalties)
- Starts completing puzzle (inconsistent steps)

### Phase 3: Optimization (Episodes 150-300)
- Focuses on reducing steps
- Avoids all repetition patterns (single moves and sequences)
- Chases efficiency bonuses
- Steps consistently decrease episode-to-episode

### Phase 4: Mastery (Episodes 300+)
- Achieves near-optimal solutions (7 steps for 3 discs)
- Gets +200 rewards for optimal
- Largest disc never removed from target once placed
- Zero repetition penalties
- Consistent performance

## Monitoring Training

Watch for these patterns indicating successful learning:

1. **Early episodes**: High penalties (-50, -30, -20, -15, -10) → Learning rules
2. **Mid episodes**: More +25, +20 rewards → Found strategy
3. **Late episodes**: +2 bonuses every step → Maintaining correct state
3. **Late episodes**: High completion bonuses (100-200) → Optimizing
4. **Success metric**: Steps trending from 1000 → 100 → 20 → 7-10

## Key Improvements Over Basic Reward

| Old System | New System | Benefit |
|------------|------------|---------|
| -1 per step | -0.1 per step | Less aggressive, allows exploration |
| No largest disc logic | +20/-15 for largest disc | Learns core strategy |
| No repetition detection | -10 for oscillation | Prevents wasted moves |
| Fixed completion bonus | Progressive improvement bonus | Continuous learning |
| No efficiency tracking | Rewards beating best | Long-term optimization |

This system teaches the agent **how to think** about Tower of Hanoi, not just memorize moves!
