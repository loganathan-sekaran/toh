# UI Progress & Learning Metrics Improvements

## Overview

Added comprehensive visual progress indicators and real-time learning metrics to help users understand:
1. **How many episodes are remaining** - Visual progress bar
2. **Learning improvement** - Success rate trends, average steps, and recent performance
3. **Training status** - Episode counts and completion percentage

## New UI Features

### 1. Progress Bar 📊
- **Location:** Below the main info panel
- **Shows:** Current episode / Total episodes with percentage
- **Format:** "Episode 45 / 100 (45%)"
- **Visual:** Green progress bar that fills as training progresses
- **Updates:** Real-time after each episode

### 2. Training Progress Section 📈

A dedicated "Training Progress" panel displays:

#### Episode Progress
- Progress bar showing X / Y episodes completed
- Clear visual indicator of training completion

#### Learning Metrics Grid
Four key metrics displayed in a 2x2 grid:

**Row 1:**
- **Total Episodes:** Current episode count
- **Avg Steps:** Average steps per episode (lower is better as agent learns)

**Row 2:**
- **Best Success Rate:** Highest success rate achieved so far
- **Recent Success (last 10):** Success rate for last 10 episodes (shows current performance)

### 3. Enhanced Info Panel
Original panel remains with:
- Current episode number
- Current step in episode
- Cumulative reward
- Epsilon (exploration rate - decreases over time)
- Overall success rate

## What Each Metric Tells You

### 📊 Progress Bar
**What it shows:** How far along in training you are  
**How to read it:** "75 / 100 episodes (75%)" means 75% done, 25 episodes remaining  
**When to stop:** You can safely stop when you see satisfactory success rates, even before 100%

### 🎯 Success Rate (Overall)
**What it shows:** Percentage of successful puzzle completions across all episodes  
**How to read it:** Higher is better. 80%+ is excellent for Tower of Hanoi  
**Learning indicator:** Should trend upward as training progresses

### 📉 Avg Steps
**What it shows:** Average number of moves per episode  
**How to read it:** Lower is better. Optimal solution for 3 discs is 7 steps  
**Learning indicator:** Should trend downward as agent learns efficient strategies

### 🏆 Best Success Rate
**What it shows:** Peak performance achieved  
**How to read it:** Shows the agent's potential when it performs well  
**Learning indicator:** Should increase and stabilize as agent masters the task

### 🔄 Recent Success (last 10)
**What it shows:** Performance consistency in recent episodes  
**How to read it:** More reliable indicator of current agent capability than overall average  
**Learning indicator:** Should converge toward best success rate as learning stabilizes

### 🎲 Epsilon
**What it shows:** Exploration vs. exploitation rate  
**How to read it:** Starts at 0.5 (50% random), decays to 0.01 (1% random)  
**Learning indicator:** As this decreases, agent relies more on learned strategy

## Example Training Progression

### Early Training (Episodes 1-20)
```
Progress: 15 / 100 (15%)
Avg Steps: 156.3 ← High, lots of trial and error
Success Rate: 13.3% ← Low, still exploring
Best: 20.0% ← Had a lucky streak
Recent (last 10): 10.0% ← Current performance unstable
Epsilon: 0.42 ← Still exploring a lot
```
**Interpretation:** Agent is exploring, performance is erratic but slowly improving.

### Mid Training (Episodes 40-60)
```
Progress: 50 / 100 (50%)
Avg Steps: 98.4 ← Improving
Success Rate: 52.0% ← Better than random
Best: 70.0% ← Can do well consistently
Recent (last 10): 60.0% ← Current performance is good
Epsilon: 0.28 ← Balancing exploration and learned strategies
```
**Interpretation:** Agent is learning patterns, success rate climbing, occasional oscillations but improving.

### Late Training (Episodes 80-100)
```
Progress: 90 / 100 (90%)
Avg Steps: 45.2 ← Much better
Success Rate: 78.9% ← Very good
Best: 90.0% ← Near-optimal performance possible
Recent (last 10): 80.0% ← Consistent high performance
Epsilon: 0.12 ← Mostly exploiting learned strategy
```
**Interpretation:** Agent has learned effective strategies, performance is stable and high. Could stop here.

## When to Stop Training

You can safely stop training when you see:

1. **Stabilized Success Rate:** Recent success rate stops improving (±5% over 20 episodes)
2. **High Performance:** Success rate > 70% and avg steps < 50 for 3-disc ToH
3. **Checkpoint Reached:** Every 100 episodes, a checkpoint is auto-saved
4. **Good Enough:** If you're satisfied with current metrics

## Using the Stop Button

The "Stop Training" button now:
1. ✅ Saves the current model with accurate episode count
2. ✅ Preserves all learning progress
3. ✅ Records final metrics in metadata
4. ✅ Shows confirmation with success rate and avg steps

No more lost models!

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- **`visualizer.py`:**
  - Added QProgressBar for episode tracking
  - Added QGroupBox with learning metrics grid
  - Added tracking variables for history and best performance
  - Enhanced `update_info()` to calculate and display metrics

- **`gui_launcher.py`:**
  - Modified TrainingWorker to send target_episodes on start
  - Enhanced progress updates with avg_steps and episode_success
  - Added comprehensive metrics in update_info emissions

### New Data Flow
```
TrainingWorker → update_info.emit(data) → Visualizer.update_info(data)
                                            ↓
                           Updates: Progress Bar
                                   Metrics Grid
                                   History Tracking
                                   Best Performance
```

### Metrics Calculated
- **success_rate:** (success_count / episodes) * 100
- **avg_steps:** total_steps / episodes
- **best_success_rate:** max(all success_rates)
- **recent_success:** avg(last 10 episode successes) * 100

## Benefits

1. **No More Guessing:** See exactly how many episodes remain
2. **Informed Decisions:** Stop training when performance plateaus
3. **Learning Visibility:** Watch the agent improve in real-time
4. **Performance Trends:** Understand if agent is still learning or stuck
5. **Checkpoint Awareness:** Know when auto-saves occur (every 100 episodes)

## Testing

Start training with the GUI:
```bash
./start_gui.sh
```

You should immediately see:
- Progress bar showing "0 / X episodes (0%)" where X is your episode target
- All metrics initialized to 0
- Metrics updating in real-time as training progresses
- Progress bar filling up with green
- Learning metrics showing improvement trends

Try stopping at episode 50 - you'll see accurate "50 episodes completed" in the save confirmation!
